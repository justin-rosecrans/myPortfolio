      <p>
        When I'm not busy delving into the intricacies of programming languages,
        you'll often find me immersed in the captivating realm of science
        fiction. I'm a devoted follower of shows like Star Trek, where I eagerly
        voyage through the cosmos alongside intrepid space explorers. The allure
        of fantastical tales doesn't stop there â€“ I'm an avid reader too. My
        bookshelf proudly displays a collection that spans from the mythical
        lands of Middle-earth in Lord of the Rings to the enigmatic adventures
        of Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher series. I've traversed the dimensions
        of time in H.G. Wells' Time Machine and embarked on epic quests with the
        heroes of Wheel of Time.
